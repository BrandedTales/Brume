  value: 'None here remember her arrival, and many believe that she dwelt here before
    the brume shrouded the land. Revered by the people here for her powers to heal
    the sick and and banish the monsters that dwell here; Sibra cuts an unusual figure
    in this land of dim hope. An aged and matronly figure clothed in simple robes
    and adorned with numerous godly symbols that seem to glow with an inner light.
    Where she travels she brings hope and the compelling words of divine beings far
    removed from this sinister place. '
