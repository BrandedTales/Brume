  value: 'If the shimmering sigils upon her robes weren''t enough to identify Carmine
    as an arcanist, than the top of her staff, which burns with an eternal fire, surely
    would. Unlike others who found themselves here; swept away through the brume,
    Carmin came through an act of grand arcana. Her goal to seek vengeance on the
    one that butchered her brother. Within moments of arriving the deed was done and
    the target of her hatred but cinders at her feet. Now, trapped like everyone else,
    she bends her will and magics to the task of returning home; no matter the cost. '
