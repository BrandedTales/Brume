  value: At any true gathering of tittering lady's and foppish gentleman can be found
    the Lady Velvet. Her beauty along with shining blue eyes of mirth and mischief
    draw out scandalous secrets and the wildest of rumours from all those around her.  An
    adventurous, some say dangerous, streak runs through the Lady and she often picks
    at the webs of intrigue woven by the powerful or, along with her retinue, explores
    places others fear to tread. Such activities often cost others their lives in
    her service, but have also made the Lady and those around her obscenely rich.
