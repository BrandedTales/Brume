  value: Clad in shining half plate armor atop a silver embroidered azure robe The
    Sixth cuts a striking and dynamic figure against the somber backdrop of this benighted
    land. Since The Sixths arrival to the town he has quickly developed a reputation
    as a tireless  paragon of heroism and strength. Armed with the Valesti, his enchanted
    sword awash with a radiant silver light, The Sixth has vowed that as long as he
    lives, the people of this place have a champion.
